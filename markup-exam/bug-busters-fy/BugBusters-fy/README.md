# BugBusters-fy - Music Streaming Web Application

## Description

This project is a music and audio streaming web application inspired by Spotify.  
The application allows users to browse music content such as playlists, albums, and tracks through a modern and responsive user interface.

The main goal of the project is to implement a **frontend markup-based interface**, recreating the structure and layout of a modern music streaming platform using semantic HTML and SCSS.

The project was developed as a **final exam project for a Frontend Web Development course**.

---

## Technologies Used

The application is built using the following technologies:

- **HTML5** – for the structure and semantic markup
- **SCSS (Sass)** – for styling and modular CSS architecture
- **Vanilla JavaScript** – for interactive functionality
- **SCSS Mixins** – to reuse common styling logic
- **Component-based structure** – to organize UI elements

---

## Features

- Fully responsive design that works across **desktop, tablet, and mobile devices**
- Layout built with **CSS Grid** and **Flexbox**
- Responsive behavior implemented with **SCSS** and **media queries**
- Clean and well-structured codebase using a **component-based SCSS architecture**

### Music Player

- Interactive music player
- Play / Pause controls
- Next and Previous track navigation
- Progress bar showing **current playback time and remaining time**
- Volume control with **mute functionality**
- Track information updates dynamically (cover image and song title)

### Dynamic UI Elements

- Song data is loaded from a **JavaScript array**
- UI updates depending on the currently selected track
- **Sidebar popup** that can be opened and closed from header navigation buttons
