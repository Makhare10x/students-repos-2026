# Spotify-10xHunter

## Project Overview
A Spotify Web UI clone built as a team markup exam for 10X Academy (Frontend module). The project replicates Spotify's desktop and mobile layouts based on a provided Figma design, using only HTML, CSS/SCSS, and vanilla JavaScript — no frameworks.

## Team Decisions

### Development Approach
- We built the project **Desktop First**.
- Used **Flexbox** as the primary layout method after group discussions on how to structure the main grid (sidebar + main content + player).

### Layout Discussion
Early on, we had a key debate: **does the "My Library" button belong to the header or to the sidebar?** In the Figma design, it visually sits at the boundary between the two. After discussing it in our online calls, we agreed to treat it as part of the sidebar navigation on desktop, while on mobile it becomes a bottom nav item.

### Task Management
We tracked tasks using Notion with its shared task board, with each member assigned clear responsibilities, while taking notes of any new bug reports or discovered features with free to choose culture.

### Team Communication
- We regularly held **online meetups** (group calls) to discuss progress, review code structure, analyze each other's implementations, and resolve blockers.
- Beyond calls, we collaborated through **pull request reviews and comments** — you can trace these discussions in the PR history.

### Naming Convention
- We independently arrived at the same conclusion: use **BEM** (`block__element--modifier`) for CSS class naming — no camelCase.
- This wasn't a top-down rule; each member naturally gravitated toward BEM during their own work, and when we compared code in our meetups, we found we were already consistent.

### Technical Research
We researched specific CSS details together, such as custom `cubic-bezier` timing functions for smooth animations on hover and transitions.

### Team Lead
- **Gigi Nemsadze** served as Team Lead.
- Responsibilities: repo initialization, task coordination, PR reviews, and keeping the team aligned on structure and conventions.

## Workflow
- Each feature was developed on its own branch (`feat/sidebar`, `feat/homepage`, `feat/player`, etc.).
- Changes were integrated through **pull requests** (18 PRs merged in total).
- Team members reviewed each other's PRs before merging — no direct pushes to main.
- We used meaningful branch names following the `feat/`, `fix/`, `feature/`, `docs/` convention.

## Tech Stack
- HTML
- CSS / SASS (7-1 pattern: abstracts, base, components, layout, pages)
- JavaScript (vanilla)
- Git / GitHub
